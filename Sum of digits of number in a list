''' Write a function called integer_lengths() that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all their
lengths. For instance, given [2,44,532,3,44,22], the sum of the lengths is 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11. '''


lst = []

    numbers = str(input('Enter number '))
    lst.append(numbers)

    sum = 0
    lengths = [len(i) for i in lst]

    for i in range(len(lengths)):
        sum = sum + lengths[i]
    return sum
