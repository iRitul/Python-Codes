''' I/p:

Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

C is 50. H is 30.D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24  '''

import math
c = 50
h = 30
value = []
items = [int(x) for x in input().split(',')]
for d in items:
    value.append(str(int(round(math.sqrt(2*c*float(d)/h)))))

for i in range(len(value)):
    print(value[i])
